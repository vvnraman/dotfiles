dotfiles overview
*****************

``dotfiles`` is a colloquial term which encapsulates the configuration files
for programs which we use on a day to day basis, typically on Linux, but now
also true for Windows/Mac.

In our case, we have configurations for the following tools

* ``tmux``

* ``bash``

* ``nvim``

* ``fish``

* ``starship``

The neovim config docs are separately available at
`neovim config docs`_, generated by the `neovim-config`_ repo.
