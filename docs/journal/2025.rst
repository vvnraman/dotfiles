2025-11-15 - Saturday
======================

- Picked up where I left off in March 2025. That was mostly updaing my Neovim config.
  They had not been synced with ``dotfiles`` until now.

- Wrapped up work on ``typr`` cli for generating docs.

  TODO - Push generated pages to ``gh-pages`` branch as was being done in the
  ``Makefile``.
